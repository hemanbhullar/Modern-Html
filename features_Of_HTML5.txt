Features of HTML5 are:
Some of the main features of HTML5 are as follows:

* Improved Multimedia support - HTML5 allows for integrating multimedia elements such as <audio> and <video> directly into web pages without the need for plugins like Flash.

* Canvas element - HTML5 introduced the <canvas> element, allowing dynamic, interactive graphics to be created and manipulated within a web page.

*Geolocation API is an API for obtaining the user's location, enabling web applications to offer location-based services.

Example: Get the user's current location.

<body>
    <script>
        if ("geolocation" in navigator) {
            navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition((position) => {
                console.log(
                    `User current coordinates la=${position.coords.latitude},
                    lo=${position.coords.longitude}`
                );
            });
        } else {
            console.log("geolocation is not available");
        }
        </script>
</body>

One popup will appear, asking the browser to know your location.

*Local Storage - HTML5 introduced the localStorage API, which allows for the storage of data on the user's device, improving performance and reducing the need for round-trips to the server.

*New Structural Elements - HTML5 introduced new semantic elements such as <header>, <footer>, <nav>, and <article>, etc. that make it easier to structure and organize content on a web page.

* Form Improvements - HTML5 introduced several improvements to forms, including new input types like date, time, and color, as well as new attributes such as required and autofocus.

* Accessibility improvements - HTML5 provides better support for accessibility, including the ability to provide alternative text for images and improved support for screen readers.
